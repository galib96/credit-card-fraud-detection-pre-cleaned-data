# Credit Card Fraud Detection Pre Cleaned Data.

In this repository, the goal is to build a model which can detect credit card frauds.
The dataset was taken from Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

The issue of class imbalance was addressed.

Four sci-kit Learn model algorithms were used on the dataset to check which ne is better.
